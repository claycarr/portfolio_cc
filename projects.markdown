  <h3>Description</h3>
<p>Term Buddy is a simple time and contact management tool for students. I designed and developed this application as part of my degree program in software development. This project was developed for use on Android devices. Specifically, the minimum target operating system was Marshmallow 6.0 (API level 23) and the target operating system was Android Pie 9.0 (API level 28). This resulted in the application being compatible with versions Marshmallow 6.0 up through Pie 9.0. </p>
